								<h3>Black Powder Powered Dual Recovery System</h3>
								<h4>Rocketry Recovery System Design</h4>
									<span>
										I joined the team as a Mechanical Engineer on the recovery sub-system. I was tasked 
										with designing and modifying the system to be flight ready for our first ever 10,000 
										ft launch.
										<br>
										<br>
										Over the course of the first six months, I worked alongside the systems engineer and 
										the electronic avionics team to understand their design requirements and translate 
										them over to a viable design. After the design process, I spent the next six months 
										building and testing the system.

										students remotely. We envision a world where students arrive to class not worrying 
										about their first lecture of the day, but rather look forward to the smell of freshly 
										made ramen.
										<br>
										<br>
										Our ramen-maker has features such as a ramen-dispenser, a powder dispenser, a water 
										dispenser, automatic control to turn on the hot-plate, and one-click start/stop 
										functionality that has been curated to make the best type of ramen possible.

								<h3>Batch Reverse Osmosis</h3>
								<h4>Water Desalination</h4>
									<span>
										The goal of the research is to refine and validate thermodynamic models of BRO (Batch 
										Reverse Osmosis) and t-BRO to predict the performance of a full-scale system and 
										determine whether the technology is a candidate for pilot-scale testing with sunlight 
										and real groundwater. A successful outcome of the project will demonstrate a 
										thermally-driven batch RO process at lab scale. Furthermore, it will produce data 
										paired with modeling to show the potential achievable energy efficiency versus 
										salinity and recovery. 
										<br>
										<br>
										I was part of the team as a mechanical engineer who was designing the physical model
										to conduct the experiments. I was also helping to construct a model for the More Water
										Less Concentrate challenge being hosted by NASA.

								<h4>SARS-CoV-2 Virus Finder</h4>
									<span>
										The goal of this paper was to develop an algorithm that could take a FATSA file 
										and check if it contained the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In bio-informatics and biochemistry, 
										the FASTA format is a text-based format for representing amino acid (protein) 
										sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter 
										codes.
										<br>
										<br>
										After studying and understanding how scientists found virus strains, I broke down 
										the process into smaller increments. This incremental development process helped 
										me break down the process into small helper functions which could work in 
										conjunction to find the virus strain.

										The goal of this project was to design an interactive program using the 
										Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. The project was part of a final 
										assignment for a software design course. My partner, Merwan, and I wanted 
										to design something that would fulfill the requirements while also making 
										something we could play against each other in our dorms. This MVC structure 
										helped us break down the coding process through incremental development. It 
										also allowed us to build a game that was modular in nature so that we could 
										change the output/input method in future iterations.

								<h3>Interactive Seaborn Plots based of BeautifulSoup</h3>
								<h4>"Moreyball" NBA Computational Analysis</h4>
									<span>
										Since the introduction of the three-point shot in 1979, its impact on the game 
										has changed wildly. Initially regarded as an obscure shot that only a few players 
										would be capable of making, it has become one of the most important facets of 
										professional basketball. This impact has especially manifested itself over the 
										last decade, where teams have begun to center their entire offense around shooting 
										three-pointers. This strategy, often referred to as "Moreyball" as a nod to its 
										pioneer, General Manager Daryl Morey, places emphasis on shooting layups and 
										three-pointers, and specifically eliminating long two-point shots (shots that 
										fall right inside of the three-point arc). The reason for this strategy is simple: 
										layups are made at the highest percentage of any shot, and while three-pointers 
										are made at a much lower percentage, the extra point compensates for the lost 
										efficiency.

								<h3>Slowing Down Rates of Sulfation using Salt Compounds</h3>
								<h4>Lead-Battery Research</h4>
									<span>
										Abstract: In the 21st century electricity is no longer just a want, but a need. The 
										high prices of electricity have negatively impacted those who fall in the lower 
										socio-economic strand of developing countries because this means they have less 
										disposable income left for other important needs such as education, sanitation, 
										and food. For example, Indian farmers use lead-acid batteries to power their 
										households which can account for 32% of their monthly spending as cited by the 
										Indian National Defence Report of 2017.

								<h3>Cutting Down on Emissions Caused by Students Move-Out Every Year</h3>
								<h4>Sustainability Consulting @ Olin</h4>
									<span>
										I worked on a project with the goal of reducing the Olin’s carbon dioxide emissions. 
										The project our team formed around was reducing Olin’s emissions associated with 
										student move out in the spring. In past years, a small group of volunteers have 
										stepped up to sort these items for donations, but this is not a sustainable plan 
										if those people leave the college. Instead, we need student-led cultural change where 
										the responsibility of what gets left behind shifts from facilities and unpaid volunteers 
										to an organized system that addresses this issue. The following paper details our proposal 
										for a move out donation program that will make this needed cultural shift.

								<h3>Ironman themed Smart-Mirror</h3>
								<h4>J.A.R.V.I.S</h4>
									<span>
										My goal was to build a smart mirror that I could glance at while getting ready for 
										school. The main modules it needed was the time, weather, my calendar for the day, 
										to-do list, and a news summary. I managed to use the magic-mirror module on GitHub 
										and adapt it for my needs. Inspired by Marvel, I created my own JARVIS module which 
										allowed the mirror to communicate simple messages such as ‘Good Morning’ using clips 
										from the IRONMAN movies. The physical mirror was built using a recycled one-way LCD 
										screen and a raspberry-pi with a Linux backend. I’m currently working on integrating 
										it with WIFI speakers to use as an alternative to Google Home / Amazon Alexa in my 
										dorm room.

								<h3>Using Fourier Transformations to Detect Fallings</h3>

										Our Fall De_Tech algorithm makes use of the sensors present in a smartphone to detect 
										when someone has fallen. The sensor that we utilized for this project is the 
										accelerometer. Our goal was to collect data of someone walking/running normally with 
										the phone and to collect data of someone falling with the phone in various ways 
										(tripping, stumbling without falling all the way over, rolling, etc.). We then compared 
										the data and used any anomalies present in the falling data to help us understand 
										what to look for in order to tell whether or not someone has fallen.

								<h3>Using Eigenvectors to Design an OCR Algorithm</h3>

										The goal of this project was to create a handwriting recognition algorithm from 
										scratch. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has been around for quite 
										some time, but we wanted to design a machine-learning version that uses Principal 
										Component Analysis (PCA) to recognize handwritten information.
										<br>
										<br>
										I was in-charge of designing the framework to integrate the machine learning 
										components through the use of eigenvectors.

								<h3>Using RANSAC Algorithms to Develop Contour Fields  </h3>
								<h4>Spatial Recognition Robot</h4>
									<span>
										The goal of this project was to self-drive a robot using LIDAR scans in the 
										direction of a target object. LIDAR is a method for determining ranges by 
										targeting an object with a laser and measuring the time for the reflected 
										light to return to the receiver. After collecting the data, we had to translate 
										the scan into objects that the robot could detect and avoid. I was in charge of 
										developing the RANSAC algorithm using orthogonality. Random sample consensus 
										(RANSAC) is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model 
										from a set of observed data that contains outliers.
